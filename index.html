<h1>Nour Naji</h1>
<p>  Good afternoon.
    My name is Nour Naji, a recent graduate in Computer Systems Engineering from Birzeit University.
     During my studies, I gained strong programming skills in languages like Java, C, Python, and frameworks such as ASP.NET and 
     Android development. I've also worked on various projects that enhanced my problem-solving abilities and teamwork.</p>

<h2>My City: Salfit</h2>
<p>
     Salfit is a Palestinian city located in the northern West Bank, serving as the administrative center of the Salfit Governorate. It is known for its fertile agricultural land, with olive cultivation being one of its main activities, producing some of the finest olive oil in Palestine. Despite its agricultural richness, the city faces challenges due to the presence of surrounding Israeli settlements, which hinder its urban and economic expansion. In recent years, Salfit has focused on improving its infrastructure and promoting local commerce, striving to overcome these obstacles and enhance the quality of life for its residents.
